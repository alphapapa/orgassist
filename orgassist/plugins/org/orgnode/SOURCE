Code with changes from:
https://github.com/blaa/orgnode

Forked from: https://github.com/albins/orgnode
Which was forked from: Takafumi Araraki's fork of Charles Cave's Python library for parsing org-mode files 

This one might be better in future:
https://github.com/bjonnh/PyOrgMode
But I'd try to convince them to change to LGPL
